# Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

+ expected value is a concept applied to the known probabilities so E[x] is calculated based on actual probabilities of the ocurrence of x. E[x] = P(x)\*x

+ mean is a concept applied to the sample. mean(x) = frequence of x in sample \* x

	- These concepts are related but not the same. E[x] is the limit of mean(x) with n -> infinity

### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

There are many. I do not wholeheartedly agree with the author of the given article but I understand his point of view. I do agree scientists tend to overvalue them and pop-science magazines treat the .05 threshold almost axiomaticly.

But his best argument in my humble opinion is that the public does not know how to interpret is. A p-value under .05 means nothing more than: 'i cannot reject with a level of confidence of 95% that these values do not differ due to randomness'

It does not PROVE/DISPROVE. it's an arbitrary convention that at most should be used as a baseline for reviewers to take a deeper look into some matter.

And for this, it is a good measure to start with.

But for me, the biggest issue with p\_values is the epidemic of p-hacking that has been going on since science inception. I saw people that I used to respect doing this in different manners. It is a result of lack of ethics on the scientists part and pervasive incentives by the academia publication system. From magazines to research units, everyone is disregarding the fraud that has been going on.

P\_values do not represent an absolute measure of approval of an hypothesis, are not sufficient for robust conclusions and should be handled as a tool instead of THE tool.
